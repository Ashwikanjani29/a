single page application: conatins only one tab any changes also in 1 tab
no page refreshing and reloading
multi page application:contains multiple tabs,page refresing,reloading.

- react is a single page application.

virtual DOM:
- virtualDOM is a virtual representation of a UI which is kept in a memory
later synced with Real DOM with the help of library called as "ReactDOM"

- the updation of realDOM is with virtualDOM
- the entire process of updating the realDOM with the help of VDOM is called as"Reconcialation"

*******************
JSX:
- JSX stands for javascript and XML
- JSX is a javascript syntax extension used to create HTML-markup in the react.
- Actual way to create a element in reacr is by using method called as,
        -React.craeteElement("tagname",{property:"value"}/null,content/childern)

- JSX is not a part of raect but it is recommend to use in react.
***********
Rules of JSX:
1.every ele irrespective of paired/unpaired tag both most be closed
ex: <h1></h1>,,<input/>

2.more than 1 JSX ele is used then they must be wrapped with one parent class element
ex:
<div>
<section>


*************
JSX Expression: used to call the the variable,mathematical expression inside the element.
Syntax:<h1>{variable/expression}</h1>


************************
components:
- components are the files or modules which consiste=s of javascript releated logics which canbe reused.
1.class based components(CBC)
2.Functional based components(FBC)

1.class based components(CBC):
- similar to javascript es6 class.
- CBC components are statefull coponents.
syntax: 
class Person{
    constructor(name,age){
        this.name=name;
        this.age=age;
    }
}
class Child extends Person{
    constructor(name,age,city){
        super();
        this.city=city;
    }
}


syntax: 
class App extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return(
            //JSX
        )
    }
}
export default App;


2.Functional based components(FBC)
- similar to JS functions 
-FBC is stateless becaues there is no state object until react v16.8

syntax:
function App(){
    return(

    )
}
export default App;
        or
const App()=>{

}

- while creating react component the name capital letters
-extension of file should be .js or .jsx


*************
component composition :
- component composition is used to combine multiple components into single application

*********
props:
- props is nothing but properties similar to HTML attributes.
- props is an object.
- immutable object
- props is an object used to exchange info or data from parent component to child component.


props.chilfren : it is a special 

*******************
state:
- exchanging data from student component to parent component
- is a mutable object which is used to store/isolate the data inside the component.


*************
Class Component:
- class component is having the state object by default.
constructor(){
        super();
        this.state={
            users:["vamshi","577","vaishali","chetan","ranjith"],
            num:100
        };
    }
- to update the state object of a class component we have a method "this.setState()"


Functional Component:
- by default  functional component   stateledd because there is no object.
-  in a react v16.8,they intrioduce a concept called as"hooks"
 syntax:const[state,setState]=useStsre(intialValue);

State - it will used to 

Hooks:
hooks is noyhing but a function which implemnts all the features of class component

basic hooks are:
1.useState()
2.useEffect():

- it allows developers to make neccessry changes or side effects in side the component.
Syntax:
useEffect(callbackfn , dependency)


3.useContext():
- to avoid props drilling we use context api.
- this hook is used to pass the data directly to child  component.
- 


**************
4.useRef():
- ref is used to target native or real DOM elements.
- using ref makes functionality more easier bt costlier.



list & keys: every listem items fcrom the array sholud have a unique key prop 
so that it can track all the changes done in the lists
*********************
React,Fragments:
- this will act as a parent element for jsx elements


****************
Tight Coupling:
- one is dependent upon another.

Styling:
1.External Stlesheet
2.Inline CSS
3.Module CSS


*****************************
controlled components or elements:
- form handling:
<form>
<input type='text'>
</form>
